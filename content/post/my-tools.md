# My Tools

As a developer, my laptop is my primary tool for pretty much everything work related, and
as a geek, it is my primary tool for many things fun related!

Like the past several places I've worked, my current work uses all Macintosh machines 
for development. For me, they are pretty much the optimal developer environment for
everything except Windows or Linux development. For the cloud development work I do, however,
there really isn't anything better than a user-friendly UNIX-like environment.

On top of Mac OS, however, there are tools that make my life way better. I'd like to 
share them, and how I have them set up, today.

There are a few OSX applications I love:

* [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus)
* Cyberduck
* Macvim
* Hammerspoon 
* 1Password
* Alfred
* Dash
