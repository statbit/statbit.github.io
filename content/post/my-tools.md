# My Tools

As a developer, my laptop is my primary tool for pretty much everything work related, and
as a geek, it is my primary tool for many things fun related!

Like the past several places I've worked, my current work uses all Macintosh machines 
for development. For me, they are pretty much the optimal developer environment for
everything except Windows or Linux development. For the cloud development work I do, however,
there really isn't anything better than a user-friendly UNIX-like environment.

On top of Mac OS, however, there are tools that make my life way better. I'd like to 
share them, and how I have them set up, today.


## Mac OS applications

There are a few OSX applications I love:

* [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus)
* [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io)
* [Macvim](http://www.vim.org)
* [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org)
* [1Password](https://1password.com)
* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com)
* [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash)

Omnifocus, Cyberduck, 1Password, Macvim and Dash I use pretty much out of the box. 

Alfred I have a few custom workflows (search maven, and giphy), but the main thing I use
with Alfred is the Dash workflow. It comes bundled with the Dash app, and lets you 
search through documentation for various languages and libraries very quickly.

HammerSpoon is a little different. It doesn't really do much out of the box. Rather,
it is a scripting environment that has Lua libraries for hooking into Mac OS. It makes
it easy to rearrange windows, bind to keystrokes, call APIs (even receive callbacks), 
run scripts, AppleScripts, add menu status bars and much more. 

I now use it as a quick launcher, caffiene (keep awake) tool, pomodoro timer,
window mover and resizer, expose replacement, and a quick giphy searcher because never enough gifs. 


## Command line stuff

I spend a ton of time at the command line, both because it is usefule, and because it is 
so easily customized. There are a few command line tools that make life better, faster and 
more exciting.

In no particular order:

* Zsh
* homebrew
* tmux
* fzf
* Vim 8
* todolist
* jq
* ansiweather
* ctags
* hugo
* pandoc
